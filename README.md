Crossing with Turtle 🐢🚗
A fun project where colorful cars zoom around using Python’s turtle module! Cars move backward or forward based on their starting point—simple and exciting!

Just for Fun 😄
By the way, I said "damn" somewhere in the code, but it wasn’t out of frustration—it was for fun! Hope you enjoy the ride!
